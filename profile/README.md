# 🚀 How We Pay Only $27 for Flexiyo

Flexiyo runs lean and mean with a slick infra powered by **Railway**, **Cloudflare**, and **Wasabi**. Here’s how we keep costs at **$27/month** while staying fast and scalable—shared resources and all.

## ⚡ **Railway Pro Plan**

| **Service**               | **CPU**     | **Memory** |
|---------------------------|-------------|------------|
| PostgreSQL (fiyopgdb)     | 6 vCPU      | 8 GB       |
| MongoDB (fiyomgdb)        | 4 vCPU      | 6 GB       |
| APIs (fiyoauth, fiyomain) | 6 vCPU each | 4 GB each  |
| WebSockets (fiyochat)     | 8 vCPU      | 6 GB       |
| RedisDB (fiyorsdb)        | 2 vCPU      | 4 GB       |

### Why Railway’s Shared Setup?
Railway’s Pro plan hooks us up with 32 vCPUs and 32 GB RAM—shared across all users, not just Flexiyo. Our services sip from this warm pool, staying live with no cold-start nonsense.

- **Why We Roll With It**:  
  - 🌟 **Always Warm**: No spin-up delays—DBs, APIs, and WebSockets are ready to rip.  
  - 💸 **$20 Flat**: Covers the whole stack, keeping the wallet happy.  
  - ⚡ **Dynamic Juice**: Idle services free up resources, Flexiyo grabs what it needs.

- **Pros**:  
  - 🚀 **Zero Cold Starts**: Instant response, even on sudden spikes.  
  - 💰 **Cheap as Hell**: $20 for all this? Yes, please.  
  - 🛠 **Quick Deploys**: Railway’s flow keeps us moving fast.

- **Cons**:  
  - 📉 **Throttle Risk**: Other users maxing the 32/32 pool can slow us down.  
  - 🤔 **Shared Chaos**: Peak traffic elsewhere might choke our slice.  
  - 🔧 **No Fine-Tuning**: Shared means less control over the reins.

## 🔥 **Predicted Latency at 50,000 Users**

| **Service**               | **Predicted Latency** | **Notes**                                                         |
|---------------------------|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL (fiyopgdb)     | 20-40 ms             | Shared CPU might stretch queries under load.                      |
| MongoDB (fiyomgdb)        | 20-40 ms             | Reads stay solid, writes lag if resources thin out.               |
| APIs (fiyoauth, fiyomain) | 30-50 ms             | Concurrent hits and shared vCPUs bump it up.                      |
| WebSockets (fiyochat)     | 60-80 ms             | Real-time takes a hit if Railway’s pool gets crowded.             |
| RedisDB (fiyorsdb)        | 0-15 ms              | Cache king—stays fast unless memory’s slammed.                    |
| Cloudflare CDN (fiyocdn)  | 10-20 ms             | Edge caching keeps it tight, no matter the load.                  |
| Cloudflare Pages (fiyo)   | 10-20 ms             | Static and speedy, untouched by Railway’s chaos.                  |
| Wasabi (fiyost)           | 100-120 ms           | Object storage lags a bit under concurrent pulls.                 |

## 🌟 **Why It Works**
This setup keeps Flexiyo humming at **$26.99/month**—shared 32/32 resources on Railway mean no cold starts and low costs, while Cloudflare and Wasabi handle the rest for free or cheap. Latency flexes a bit with shared contention, but it’s still snappy enough for real-time vibes at 50,000 users. Trade-off’s worth it for the price.

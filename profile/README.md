# 🚀 Flexiyo: Powering a Scalable App for Just $27/Month

Building a slick, cost-effective cloud setup for **Flexiyo** takes clever picks. We’ve nailed it with **Railway** for backend magic, **Wasabi** for cheap storage, and **Cloudflare** for lightning-fast CDN and security. Here’s the lowdown on our **monthly costs**, why this stack rocks, and how shared resources keep it humming.

## ⚡ **Railway: Backend & Databases**

| Service              | Plan  | vCPU | RAM   | Cost    |
|----------------------|-------|------|-------|---------|
| **PostgreSQL (fiyopgdb)** | Pro   | 8    | 12 GB | Included |
| **MongoDB (fiyomgdb)**    | Pro   | 6    | 8 GB  | Included |
| **APIs (fiyoauth, fiyomain)** | Pro   | 6 each | 4 GB each | Included |
| **RedisDB (fiyorsdb)**    | Hobby | 6    | 4 GB  | Included |
| **WebSockets (fiyochat)** | Pro   | 8    | 8 GB  | Included |

### Why Railway & Shared Resources?
Railway’s Pro plan gives us 32 vCPUs and 32 GB RAM—shared across all users on the platform, not just Flexiyo. That means our services (DBs, APIs, WebSockets) tap into a warm pool of resources that stay ready. No cold starts, just instant action when traffic hits.

- **Why We Use It**:  
  - 🌟 **Warm Resources**: No spinning up from scratch—services are always live, cutting startup lag to zero.  
  - ⚡ **Flat $20/month**: Everything fits in the Pro plan, with Redis on Hobby for caching kicks.  
  - 🛠 **Flexibility**: Resources shift dynamically—idle services free up power for others, keeping costs low.

- **Pros**:  
  - 🚀 **No Cold Starts**: Instant scaling for APIs and WebSockets.  
  - 💸 **Budget-Friendly**: $20 covers a fat stack of services.  
  - ⚡ **Fast Deploys**: Railway’s setup keeps dev time tight.

- **Cons**:  
  - 📉 **Throttling Risk**: If other users hog the 32/32 pool, our services might slow down during peaks.  
  - 🤔 **Unpredictable**: Shared means we’re at the mercy of Railway’s load—could feel the squeeze at 50,000 users.  
  - 🔧 **Less Control**: No dedicated slice, so tuning’s limited.

## 🌐 **Cloudflare: CDN & Static Hosting**

| Service          | Plan | Features                       | Cost |
|------------------|------|--------------------------------|------|
| **CDN (fiyocdn)**| Free | Global CDN, DDoS Shield, SSL   | $0   |
| **Pages (fiyo)** | Free | Static Hosting, Zero Hassle    | $0   |

**Why Cloudflare?**  
- 🌍 **Free global CDN**: Speedy delivery, locked-down traffic.  
- 📄 **Static hosting for free**: No compute costs, all edge.

## 💿 **Wasabi: Object Storage**

| Service           | Plan         | Storage | Cost    |
|-------------------|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Object Storage (fiyost)** | Pay-as-you-go | 1 TB    | $6.99   |

**Why Wasabi?**  
- 💸 **No sneaky fees**: Egress and API calls? Free. Perfect for media.  
- 🏦 **Cheaper than S3**: High reliability, low price.

## 🔥 **Why This Stack Slaps**

- **Scales Like a Dream**: APIs, WebSockets, and DBs run smooth (mostly).  
- **Storage That Saves**: Predictable costs, no surprises.  
- **CDN & Hosting Freebies**: Speed and security, zero spend.  
- **Locked at $26.99**: Budget-friendly brilliance—shared resources keep it cheap.

Check out the **average latency** at 50,000 users—proof it’s fast, with shared resource caveats:

| Service                  | Avg Latency  |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| **PostgreSQL (fiyopgdb)**| 20-40 ms     |
| **MongoDB (fiyomgdb)**   | 20-40 ms     |
| **APIs (fiyoauth)**      | 30-50 ms     |
| **APIs (fiyomain)**      | 30-50 ms     |
| **WebSockets (fiyochat)**| 60-80 ms     |
| **RedisDB (fiyorsdb)**   | 0-15 ms      |
| **Cloudflare CDN (fiyocdn)** | 10-20 ms |
| **Cloudflare Pages (fiyo)**  | 10-20 ms |
| **Wasabi (fiyost)**      | 100-120 ms   |

## 🌟 **The Bottom Line**
For just **$26.99/month**, Flexiyo delivers a **high-performance, scalable, budget-friendly infra**—thanks to Railway’s shared 32/32 pool keeping things warm and cheap. It’s a trade-off: no cold starts and low costs vs. potential throttling if the platform’s busy. Smart choices = big wins, but keep an eye on peak loads.
